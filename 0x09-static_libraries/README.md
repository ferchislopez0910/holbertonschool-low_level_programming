**0x09-static_libraries**

*In this project we will look at topics such as:*

*libraries*

A library is a file where you have a series of functions with which you will do something in the program.

Normally they are the most used functions.

They are divided into Static and Shared.

The command to create it is ar.

randlib indexes the library file.

    *Themes of project:*

        0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
        1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
        2. Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing
