# 0x1C. C - Makefiles

<p>

GNU make is a utility available in Linux that speeds up the task of compiling code from the terminal. It saves us from having to write the compilation commands by hand, which are usually very long, and instead allows us to write something much shorter that does the same thing in the end. In addition, make can do many other things that will make preparing the practices for submission a breeze.

Makefiles are files that are included in the root folder of a project that tell a program, make, which is run from the terminal, what to do with each of the code files to compile them. In order to use the "compilation recipes" that we write in a Makefile it is necessary to have the make program installed.

#### How to install:
		sudo apt-get install make

#### How to use the MakeFile:

when is a simple file do you use a:
make namefile with out extension

else:

you need this:

- all: main.c holberton.c
    `gcc main.c holberton.c -o holberton`
